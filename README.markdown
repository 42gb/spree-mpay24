Mpay Gateway
============

This integrates the [mPAY24](https://www.mpay24.com/web/en/mpay24-payment-platform.html)
payment gateway into Spree. mPAY24 is an European credit card and mobile phone payment
processing gateway.

The plugin takes care of basic security:

* transferred data is secured by a salt
* no credit card data is stored within the spree web shop
* the identity of the confirmation callback is verified

The plugin was tested with multiple web shops implemented by [we](http://wwww.starseeders.net).

Installation
============

This plugin has been tested with Spree 0.11.2 and Spree 0.40.3.

Spree 0.11
----------

Install it as a git submodule. To do this execute the following within your application
directory:

<blockquote>
 git clone git://github.com/andreashappe/spree-mpay24 vendor/extensions/mpay_gateway
 cd vendor/extensions/mpay_gateway
 git checkout spree-0.11
</blockquote>

Spree 0.40
----------

Install the gem from [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/mpay_gateway) through

<blockquote>
	gem install mpay_gateway
</blockquote>

And include it in your Project's Gemfile

<blockquote>
	gem 'mpay_gateway'
</blockquote>

Configuration
=============

Add a payment method of provider type BillingIntegration:Mpay. The
payment method comes with a configuration pane which allows setting
of basic options as:

* merchant id (for both testing as well as production mpay mode)
* shared secret (which is used as salt to secure the communication)
* base url (the URL of your website, this is needed for the confirmation callback from mPAY24)
